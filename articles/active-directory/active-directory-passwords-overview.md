# Azure AD self-service password reset for the IT professional

"Self-service" is a buzzword thrown around inside many IT departments across the world with varying meanings. The market is flooded with products that allow you to manage on-premises groups, passwords, or user profiles from the cloud or on-premises.

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) self-service password reset (SSPR) sets itself apart with ease of use and deployment. Azure AD self-service password reset combines a set of capabilities that:

* Allow your users to manage their own password
  * From any device
  * In any location
  * At any time
* Maintain compliance with policies you as an administrator define

If you are ready, you can get started with Azure AD SSPR using our [quick start guidance](active-directory-passwords-getting-started.md) and quickly have your users resetting their own passwords.

## What is possible

* **Self-service password change** allows end users or administrators to change their passwords without administrator assistance
* **Self-service account unlock** allows end users to unlock their own account without administrator assistance
* **Self-service password reset** allows end users or administrators to reset their passwords automatically without administrator assistance. Self-service password reset requires Azure AD Premium or Basic - [Azure Active Directory Editions](active-directory-editions.md).
* **Administrator-initiated password reset** allows an administrator to reset an end user’s or another administrator’s password from within the [Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-portal-overview)
* **Password management activity reports** give administrators insights into password reset and registration activity occurring in their organization - [Management reports](active-directory-passwords-reporting.md)
* **Password Writeback** allows management of on-premises passwords from the cloud so all the preceeding scenarios can be performed by, or on the behalf of, federated or password synchronized users. Password Writeback requires [Azure AD Premium](active-directory-get-started-premium.md).

## Why choose Azure AD self-service password reset

* **Reduce costs** as helpdesk and support assisted password reset is typically 20% of an IT organization’s spend
* **Improve end-user experiences** and **reduce helpdesk volume** by giving end users the power to resolve their own password issues at once without calling a helpdesk or opening a support request.
* **Drive mobility** as users can reset their passwords from wherever they are.

## Azure AD self-service password reset availability

Azure AD self-service password reset is available in three tiers depending on your subscription.

* **Azure AD Free** – Cloud-only administrators can reset their own passwords
* **Azure AD Basic** or any **Paid Office 365 Subscription** – Cloud-only users can change their own passwords and cloud-only administrators can reset their own passwords
* **Azure AD Premium** – Any user or administrator, including cloud-only, federated, or password synchronized users, can reset their own passwords. On-premises passwords require password writeback to be enabled.

## Azure AD self-service password reset, a sum of the parts

Self-service password reset in Azure AD is made up of the following components:

* **Password management configuration portal** where you can control options for how passwords are managed in your tenant via the Azure portal
* **Password reset registration portal** where users can self-register for password reset
* **Password reset portal** where users can reset their password using the challenges defined by the administrator and the answers users have provided
* **User password change portal** where users can change their own passwords by entering their old password and providing a new password
* **Password management reports** where administrators can view and analyze password activity reports for their tenants in the Azure portal
* **Password writeback to on-premises using Azure AD Connect** allows you to enable management of on-premises, federated, or password synchronized users from the cloud
