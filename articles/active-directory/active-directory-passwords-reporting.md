# Reporting options for Azure AD password management

Post deployment many organizations want to know how or if SSPR is really being used. Azure AD provides reporting features that help you to answer questions using canned reports and if you are appropriately licensed, allows you to create custom queries.

The following questions can be answered by reports that exist in the [Azure portal] (https://portal.azure.com/).

> [!NOTE]
> You must be [a global administrator](active-directory-assign-admin-roles.md#assign-or-remove-administrator-roles) and must opt-in for this data to be gathered on behalf of your organization, by visiting the reporting tab or audit logs at least once. Until doing so, data will not be collected for your organization

* How many people have registered for password reset?
* Who has registered for password reset?
* What data are people registering?
* How many people reset their passwords in the last seven days?
* What are the most common methods users or admins use to reset their passwords?
* What are common issues users or admins face when attempting to use password reset?
* What admins are resetting their own passwords frequently?
* Is there any suspicious activity going on with password reset?

## How to view password management reports in the Azure portal

In the Azure portal experience, we have an improved way to view password reset and password reset registration activity.  Follow the steps below to find the password reset and password reset registration events:

1. Navigate to [**portal.azure.com**](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Click the **More services** menu on the main Azure portal left-hand navigation
3. Search for **Azure Active Directory** in the list of services and select it
4. Click **Users & Groups** from the Azure Active Directory navigation menu
5. Click the **Audit Logs** navigation item from the Users & Groups navigation menu. This shows you all of the audit events occurring against all the users in your directory. You can filter this view to see all the password-related events, as well.
6. To filter this view to only the password reset related events, click the **Filter** button at the top of the blade.
7. From the **Filter** menu, select the **Category** dropdown, and change it to the **Self-service Password Management** category type.
8. Optionally further filter the list by choosing the specific **Activity** you are interested

## How to retrieve password management events from the Azure AD Reports and Events API

The Azure AD Reports and Events API supports retrieving all the information included in password reset and password reset registration reports. By using this API, you can download individual password reset and password reset registration events for integration with the reporting technology of your choice.

### How to get started with the reporting API

To access this data, you need to write a small app or script to retrieve it from our servers. [Learn how to get started with the Azure AD Reporting API](active-directory-reporting-api-getting-started.md).

Once you have a working script, you'll next want to examine the password reset and registration events that you can retrieve to meet your scenarios.

* [SsprActivityEvent](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt126081.aspx#BKMK_SsprActivityEvent): Lists the columns available for password reset events
* [SsprRegistrationActivityEvent](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt126081.aspx#BKMK_SsprRegistrationActivityEvent): Lists the columns available for password reset registration events

### Reporting API data retrieval limitations

Currently, the Azure AD Reports and Events API retrieves up to **75,000 individual events** of the [SsprActivityEvent](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt126081.aspx#BKMK_SsprActivityEvent) and [SsprRegistrationActivityEvent](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt126081.aspx#BKMK_SsprRegistrationActivityEvent) types, spanning the **last 30 days**.

If you need to retrieve or store data beyond this window, we suggest persisting it in an external database and using the API to query the deltas that result. Our recommendation is to begin retrieving this data when you start using SSPR in your organization, persist it externally, and then continue to track the deltas from this point forward.

## How to download password reset registration events quickly with PowerShell

In addition to using the Azure AD Reports and Events API directly, you may also use the below PowerShell script to recent registration events in your directory. This is useful in case you want to see who has registered recently, or would like to ensure that your password reset rollout is occurring as you expect.

### Description of report columns in Azure portal

The following list explains each of the report columns in detail:

* **User** – the user who attempted a password reset registration operation.

| Result |**Abandoned** – user started password reset but then stopped halfway through without completing<p>**Blocked** – user’s account was prevented to use password reset due to attempting to use the password reset page or a single password reset gate too many times in a 24-hour period<p>**Canceled** – user started password reset but then clicked the cancel button to cancel the session part way through <p>**Contacted Admin** – user had a problem during his session that he could not resolve, so the user clicked the “Contact your administrator” link instead of finishing the password reset flow<p>**Failed** – user was not able to reset a password, likely because the user was not configured to use the feature (for example, no license, missing authentication info, password-managed on-prem but writeback is off).<p>**Succeeded** – password reset was successful. |
